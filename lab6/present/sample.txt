Let G be a finite cyclic group of order n and let α be a generator
of G. Then for every integer k that divides n there exists exactly one
cyclic subgroup H of G of order k. This subgroup is generated by
αn/k. H consists exactly of the elements a ∈ G which satisfy the
condition ak = 1. There are no other subgroups.
